# How to Practice Safe Regex when encountering new Emails; Why it hurts when you HTTP.

Regular expressions, or regex, are powerful tools for pattern matching and validation in text processing. This tutorial focuses on dissecting a regular expression designed to validate email addresses. Understanding how each component of this regex works will empower you with the ability to implement effective validation in your web development projects and appreciate the intricacies of regex patterns!

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will break down the regex used for validating email addresses: 

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/` 

This pattern ensures that an email address has a username made up of characters before the `@` symbol, a domain name following it, and a top-level domain at the end, adhering to standard email formatting rules.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
The `^` and `$` symbols are the used to match the start and end of the string. This ensures that the pattern matches the whole email address.

### Quantifiers
The `+` quantifier is used after character sets to indicate one or more occurrences of the preceding element. Thich is essential for the username and domain parts of the email.

### Grouping Constructs
Parentheses `()` are used to group parts of the regex together. This makes it easier to apply quantifiers and enabling specific sections of the email to be validated or captured.

### Bracket Expressions
Square brackets `[]` define a set of characters to match. In our email regex, they are used to specify the allowable characters in the username and domain.

### Character Classes
`\d` is a character class that matches any digit. It is used in the domain part to allow numerical characters.

### The OR Operator
The `|` operator is used within grouping constructs to allow for alternate matches. Although not directly used in our email regex, it's a common component in more complex patterns.

### Flags
Flags are not directly used in this regex. In others, they can modify the behavior of the regex pattern, such as case-insensitive matching.

### Character Escapes
The backslash `\` is used to escape special characters. This allows them to be treated as literals, such as the period `.` which is otherwise a special character in regex.
